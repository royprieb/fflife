It may also be copied and redistributed by anyone who has access to it.</p>
<p>We take your privacy seriously and so should you. FASTFRESHLIFE has many features designed to help you manage your information and control how it is shared with others. This privacy policy discusses how personal information is collected and disclosed through FASTFRESHLIFE, as well as the tools available to help you control your information.</p>

If you choose to fill out the profile information, please note that this information will be posted on your FASTFRESHLIFE site (See Information Submitted to Your FASTFRESHLIFE Site) and will potentially be accessible to the entire world.</p>
<h3>Information Submitted to Your FASTFRESHLIFE Site</h3>
<p>As a registered member of FASTFRESHLIFE, you get a personal website (called a FASTFRESHLIFE site) where you can publish weblog entries, photos, additional profile information, etc. When you publish information to your FASTFRESHLIFE site, this means you are sharing the information publicly, unless you choose to use FASTFRESHLIFE features designed to help you control access to this information.</p>
<p>Other individuals may submit information to your FASTFRESHLIFE site in the form of comments. FASTFRESHLIFE gives you control over who can submit comments to your FASTFRESHLIFE site and allows you to delete comments submitted to your FASTFRESHLIFE site.</p>
<h3>Comments & Other Interactive Forums</h3>
<p>FASTFRESHLIFE offers many ways for users to interact by posting information to each others FASTFRESHLIFE sites or other parts of FASTFRESHLIFE. These features include comments on individual weblog entries or photos, comments, entries, memories, and the like (collectively, comments).</p>
<p>FASTFRESHLIFE provides features designed to give you control over comments posted to your own FASTFRESHLIFE Site. But please be aware that you may have limited control over comments that you post anywhere else:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comments on Your Own FASTFRESHLIFE Site - FASTFRESHLIFE gives you the ability to delete comments left on your own FASTFRESHLIFE site.

And if you are still not satisfied, you can ALWAYS delete your comment and post a new one. But remember: any comments you leave on anothers site may be copied and posted elsewhere by anyone who has access to it - so think before you submit!</li>

<p>FASTFRESHLIFE stores the email addresses that you provide and uses them solely to contact the owner of the email address. For invitations (such as invitations to join a network of FASTFRESHLIFE Friends), FASTFRESHLIFE sends one invitation email and may send multiple invitation reminders; for other email-based communications, FASTFRESHLIFE sends an email specific to that communication (e.g. a copy of a specific weblog entry that you are forwarding). FASTFRESHLIFE does not share, sell or rent these email addresses with any third parties (other than certain contractors performing work for FASTFRESHLIFE under confidentiality agreements.)</p>
<p>Recipients of invitations who are not registered FASTFRESHLIFE members can request that their emails be added to a black list to which FASTFRESHLIFE sends no further invitations. Recipients who are registered FASTFRESHLIFE members can control whether they receive certain invitations or other email-based communications by using the settings inside their FASTFRESHLIFE accounts.</p>
